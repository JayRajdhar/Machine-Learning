1. Linear Regression: Using Linear Regression on data of Ecommerce company to predict the Yearly Amount Spent by the user and Trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

2. Logistic Regression: Using Logistic Regression on Advertising Data to predict whether or not the user will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

3. Support Vector Machine: Using the SVM on Social Network Ads to create a model which predicts weather a customer is going to purchase a product or not based on the age and estimated saraly.

4. Naive Bayes: Using the GuassianNB on Social Network Ads to create a model which predicts weather a customer is going to purchase a product or not based on the age and estimated saraly.
